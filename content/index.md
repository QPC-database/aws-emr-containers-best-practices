Welcome to the EMR Containers Best Practices Guide. The primary goal of this project is to offer a set of best practices and templates to get started with [Amazon EMR on EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/eks/). We elected to publish this guidance to GitHub so we could iterate quickly, provide timely and effective recommendations for variety of concerns, and easily incorporate suggestions from the broader community.
